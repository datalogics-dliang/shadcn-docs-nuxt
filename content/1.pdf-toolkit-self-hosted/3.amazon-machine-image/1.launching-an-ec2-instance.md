You can access the AWS EC2 console by logging into the AWS Management Console and then searching for EC2.

For **Instance Type**, we recommend a **t3.xlarge** for normal usage.

### Select a key pair to use with your instance

Select a key pair to use with this instance. If you do not have one, follow the link to create one. Ensure that you keep the private key. AWS’ documentation on creating a key pair can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/getstarted-keypair.html).

### **Select a security group to use with your instance**

![pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-launch-ec2-step8.png](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/launching-an-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-launch-ec2-step8.png)

Select a security group to use with this instance. If you do not have one then you can create one at this time. For the purposes of this guide, we’ll use our default security group. AWS’ documentation on EC2 security groups can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html).

### Configure storage volume

Configure your storage volume. For our purposes we’ll use a **100 GiB gp3** volume. Note that the volume must be at least 100 GiB.

### Launch the instance

You can then launch the instance. You should see a confirmation message such as this one, with the ID of the new instance. Clicking on the link will take you to your instances list, where you can find further details.
