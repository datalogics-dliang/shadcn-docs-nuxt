The pdfRest Self-Hosted API products available on the AWS Marketplace offer two methods of deployment, an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and a CloudFormation Template. This guide covers the CloudFormation Template deployment.

```
Note: We highly recommend utilizing the CloudFormation Template
```

The CloudFormation Template allows you to deploy one or more pdfRest EC2 instances alongside additional, optional infrastructure. The default settings deploy a scalable group of instances with an AWS Application Load Balancer and an Elastic File System volume for storage. It is possible to use existing infrastructure components (for example, an existing EFS volume). 

The CloudFormation Template automates the deployment of infrastructure suitable for large-scale processing, using HTTPs, and the ability to autoscale instances to meet your needs.
