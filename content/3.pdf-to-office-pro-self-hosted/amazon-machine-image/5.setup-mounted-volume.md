These steps will help you set up your pdfRest PDF Forms Pro or PDF to Office Self-Hosted service to share an EFS volume with the pdfRest PDF Toolkit instance, allowing you to share uploaded files between the services.

## Setup Docker Mount

pdfRest supports a shared EFS volume between the pdfRest PDF Toolkit and the PDF to Office Pro services to chain calls between various PDF processing tools.

You can run the following commands to set up the mount for Docker to use (where EFS\_DNS\_NAME is the name of your EFS volume):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/efs
echo "EFS_DNS_NAME:/ /mnt/efs nfs4 _netdev 0 0" | sudo tee \
-a /etc/fstab
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o \
nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport \
EFS_DNS_NAME:/ /mnt/efs
chown ec2-user:ec2-user /mnt/efs
chmod 777 /mnt/efs
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Running the container with the volume

```
